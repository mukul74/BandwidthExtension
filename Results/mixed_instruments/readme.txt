Generated files for 4k-8k trained models, basically we have cymbals, drums in 8k audio, audible, pretrained model tries to predict that
Generated files for 8k-16k trained models, basically we have cymbals, drums in 8k audio, audible, pretrained model tries to predict that
Generated files for 16k-32k trained models, basically we have cymbals, drums in 8k audio, audible, pretrained model tries to predict that, target is not available, as the original dataset was sampled for 22.5kHz only.
