Description of audio samples:
Generated_BASE_T_8k_16k_I_8k_16.wav : Base model Trained for 8kHz input sampling rate and 16kHz target sampling rate and inferred for 8kHz as input and 16kHz. 
Generated_NO_POLY_T_4k_8k_I_8k_16k_LSD.wav : Non-Polyphase based model using LSD as error function while training.  model Trained for 4kHz input sampling rate and 8kHz target sampling rate and inferred for 8kHz as input and 16kHz.
